NBI techniques
==================================
### *By Javier Sorribes*, Hispasat S.A.

This repository collects a series of techniques to interact with the Northbound Interface (NBI) server for Gilat's TotalNMS.

For comprehensive information, open *Manual NBI* (in Spanish). Below however, some quick descriptions of this repo's content are provided, in alphabetical order.

EasySoap(Beta)
--------------

Contains just a few attempts to use EasySoap for NodeJS. Not of much interest, but could investigate further on this topic.

JS
--

Sample JS request which fails due to CORS' preflight issues, at least when run locally.

JS_PYServer
---------------

Sample JS requests that work when serve.py (proxy server, accounts for CORS) is running. If run locally, should do so from Web Server for  Chrome.
Also a few Python scripts that send requests to serve.py as well.
