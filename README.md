###EasySoap(Beta)
Contains just a few attempts to use EasySoap for NodeJS. Not of much interest, but could investigate further on this topic.

###JS
Sample JS request which fails due to CORS' preflight issues, at least when run locally.

###JS_PYServer
Sample JS requests that work when serve.py (proxy server, accounts for CORS) is running. If run locally, should do so from Web Server for  Chrome.
Also a few Python scripts that send requests to serve.py as well.
